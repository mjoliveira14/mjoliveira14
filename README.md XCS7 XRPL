# XCS7 – Sovereign RWA Architecture

**XCS7** is an institutional-grade architecture for anchoring a real-world physical property
into an immutable digital ledger, transforming it into a dynamic financial instrument
without transferring legal ownership.

> If it is not verifiable in law, geography, and ledger — it does not exist.
